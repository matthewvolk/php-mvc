# PHP MVC
I had lost a lot of my PHP knowledge in favor of Node.JS, so I wanted a refresher that would allow me to touch up on all the important aspects of the language and the technology stack. 

## Prerequisites:
1. PHP 7+
2. Composer

## Usage:
1. Open a terminal and run: `mkdir path/to/project && cd path/to/project && git clone https://github.com/matthewvolk/php-mvc.git .`
2. Run `composer install`
3. In a seperate terminal window, `cd path/to/project/.docker && docker-compose up` to run the Docker LAMP server
4. Open http://localhost in a browser window
